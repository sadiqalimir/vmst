        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Python tool is designed to help engineers and researchers in the field of aerospace engineering to analyze the stress-strain behavior of a material under various loading conditions. The tool calculates the von Mises stress at each point in a given stress field and checks if the material will fail under the given load.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>The tool can be used by importing the required libraries and running the provided functions. 
                The user will be prompted to input the required parameters for the analysis. 
                <br>The output of the analysis includes two plots:

                <br> 1. A 3D plot of the von Mises stress distribution in the stress field.
                <br> 2. A 2D plot of the stress-strain curve of the material.</br>
                <p>
        </section> 

        <section>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>The tool provides the following functions:
               <br> von_mises(sigma_x, sigma_y, tau_xy)</br>
                
                This function calculates the von Mises stress at a given point in a stress field, given the normal stresses sigma_x and sigma_y, and the shear stress tau_xy.
               <br> is_failure(sigma_x, sigma_y, tau_xy, yield_strength)</br>
                
                This function checks if the material will fail under the given load, given the normal stresses sigma_x and sigma_y, the shear stress tau_xy, and the yield strength of the material.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>The tool requires NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to be installed. These can be installed using pip or another package manager. For example:</p>
            <br><code>pip install numpy matplotlib</code>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>The tool is designed to be run from the command line. Once installed, navigate to the directory containing the tool and execute the following command:</p>
            <code>python von_mises.py</code>
            <p>The tool will prompt the user to enter the minimum and maximum values of sigma_x, sigma_y, and tau_xy, as well as the yield strength of the material. These parameters define the stress state of the material.</p>
            <p>The tool will then calculate the von Mises stress at each point in a grid of coordinates, and predict whether the material will fail under the given load.</p>
            <p>Finally, the tool will create two plots:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A 3D plot of the von Mises stress distribution.</li>
                <li>A 2D plot of the stress-strain curve.</li>
            </ul>
